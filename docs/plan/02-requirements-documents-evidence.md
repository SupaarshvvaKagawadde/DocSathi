# Volume 02 — Requirements, documents and evidence

JKY-Folder startup implementation plan • 9 October 2026 • proposed work only

Accountable role: Rules lead / document engineer.
Default phase: MVP.
Volume exit gate: A complete trace from every supported requirement to its condition, evidence and unresolved checks..

## How to use this volume

Every workstream contains six concrete deliverables and four acceptance situations for each deliverable.
The cases are specifications for later implementation or business validation; they are not executed results.
Use the stable IDs in issues, design reviews, release evidence and subsequent plan revisions.
Business validation uses research and operating records; engineering validation uses controlled fixtures and system evidence.
An owner may fulfill several roles early; accountability still requires a named person and an explicit decision record.
The task catalogue is a scope inventory, not a promise to build every workstream in the first release.
The master plan determines phase eligibility; a task inherits its workstream phase unless marked otherwise.
Capacity estimates must include discovery, review, security, failure recovery and support work.

## JF-02-01 — Official source intake

### Purpose and implementation decision

Outcome: Preserve authoritative instructions with provenance.
Boundary: Reviewed public sources only.
Accountable owner: Rules lead / document engineer.
Delivery phase: MVP.

### Delivery sequence

1. Confirm the inputs and constraints for official source intake.
2. Complete the six deliverables below in order unless an explicit dependency permits overlap.
3. Review every published requirement resolves to a reviewed source revision against the stated measurement cohort.
4. Resolve untrusted instructions becoming official policy before exposing the affected claim or capability.
5. Record a phase decision with the owner; unfinished deliverables remain visibly open.
