# Volume 04 — Trust, privacy, safety and quality

JKY-Folder startup implementation plan • 9 October 2026 • proposed work only

Accountable role: Security / quality lead.
Default phase: Before public launch.
Volume exit gate: Measured reliability, permission boundaries and approved handling of sensitive documents..

## How to use this volume

Every workstream contains six concrete deliverables and four acceptance situations for each deliverable.
The cases are specifications for later implementation or business validation; they are not executed results.
Use the stable IDs in issues, design reviews, release evidence and subsequent plan revisions.
Business validation uses research and operating records; engineering validation uses controlled fixtures and system evidence.
An owner may fulfill several roles early; accountability still requires a named person and an explicit decision record.
The task catalogue is a scope inventory, not a promise to build every workstream in the first release.
The master plan determines phase eligibility; a task inherits its workstream phase unless marked otherwise.
Capacity estimates must include discovery, review, security, failure recovery and support work.

## JF-04-01 — Threat modeling

#### Acceptance situations

##### JF-04-16-D6-A1 — Intended use

Given the approved user and reviewed policy permit the operation, evaluate “assurance monitoring plan” against “regressions trigger claim withdrawal or rollback”.
Then: Enforce the documented control and retain only the minimum verification evidence.
Review evidence: link the input revision, outcome and reviewer to JF-04-16-D6-A1; unresolved failure keeps this exposure scope open.

##### JF-04-16-D6-A2 — Abuse attempt

Given an adversarial actor attempts to bypass the control, evaluate “assurance monitoring plan” against “regressions trigger claim withdrawal or rollback”.
Then: Deny the unsafe action and record a redacted security event.
Review evidence: link the input revision, outcome and reviewer to JF-04-16-D6-A2; unresolved failure keeps this exposure scope open.

##### JF-04-16-D6-A3 — Policy withdrawal

Given the relevant consent, permission or processing purpose is withdrawn, evaluate “assurance monitoring plan” against “regressions trigger claim withdrawal or rollback”.
Then: Stop further affected processing and follow the approved retention or deletion policy.
Review evidence: link the input revision, outcome and reviewer to JF-04-16-D6-A3; unresolved failure keeps this exposure scope open.

##### JF-04-16-D6-A4 — Incident recovery

Given the control fails during an incident and is subsequently restored, evaluate “assurance monitoring plan” against “regressions trigger claim withdrawal or rollback”.
Then: Assess impact, repair affected outputs and validate the control before reopening.
Review evidence: link the input revision, outcome and reviewer to JF-04-16-D6-A4; unresolved failure keeps this exposure scope open.

#### Handoff

Deliver assurance monitoring plan to the next dependent owner with JF-04-16-D6 and its acceptance evidence.
Before exposure, resolve unchecked releases bypassing declared launch gates for the approved scope; communicate remaining limitations.

### Workstream completion review

Confirm all six JF-04-16 deliverables have reviewed artifacts.
Confirm the predecessor remains valid: Quality results and independent reviews.
Confirm measured evidence for: Every release has a signed scoped gate decision and rollback owner.
Confirm the intended scope remains: No self-certified compliance badges.
Confirm the owner has addressed: Unchecked releases bypassing declared launch gates.
Link relevant master-plan decisions before moving JF-04-16 into a later phase.
If this workstream is deferred, state the user-visible effect and the reason for deferral.
