# Volume 03 — Architecture, data and delivery

JKY-Folder startup implementation plan • 9 October 2026 • proposed work only

Accountable role: Technical lead.
Default phase: MVP.
Volume exit gate: A secure, recoverable modular system with reproducible evaluation and bounded processing costs..

## How to use this volume

Every workstream contains six concrete deliverables and four acceptance situations for each deliverable.
The cases are specifications for later implementation or business validation; they are not executed results.
Use the stable IDs in issues, design reviews, release evidence and subsequent plan revisions.
Business validation uses research and operating records; engineering validation uses controlled fixtures and system evidence.
An owner may fulfill several roles early; accountability still requires a named person and an explicit decision record.
The task catalogue is a scope inventory, not a promise to build every workstream in the first release.
The master plan determines phase eligibility; a task inherits its workstream phase unless marked otherwise.
Capacity estimates must include discovery, review, security, failure recovery and support work.

## JF-03-01 — System boundaries

### Purpose and implementation decision

Outcome: Keep a small team able to operate the product.
