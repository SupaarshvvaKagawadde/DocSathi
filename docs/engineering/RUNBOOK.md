# Local development runbook

The supported server runtime is Linux with Node.js 22.12 or newer and util-linux (`flock`). Verified locally with Node 22.22.0. The lockfile records the dependency versions used for this milestone. Production also requires the verified [parser host policy](../../deploy/SANDBOX.md).

## First run

1. Run `npm ci` in the repository root.
2. Optionally copy `.env.example` to `.env` for the backend origin and private data path. Keep the default ports, or use the shared shell variables below.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.
5. Choose **Explore the demo** for an isolated fictional workspace, or create a development account (under-18 applicants need a parent or guardian to approve by email).

The web client listens on port 5173 and proxies API requests to port 3001. To customize development ports, set `WEB_PORT`, `PORT` and the matching `APP_ORIGIN` in the shell so both processes receive them:

```sh
PORT=3010 WEB_PORT=5183 APP_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:5183 npm run dev
```

`server/index.ts` loads `.env` for the backend; shared dev-port overrides must be shell variables. The server binds loopback by default. It does not publish a website to the internet.

## Review a packet

Start with **Choose documents** or drop your PDF/JPEG originals into the upload entry. The first accepted file creates a folder named from that file, and later files in the same batch join it. An invalid first file creates no folder. There is no preset checklist, profile questionnaire or setup wizard in this path.

Applications and document/checklist/report tabs appear only for folders containing uploaded originals. The default checklist has one review item per uploaded file. Inspection, page previews, personal review notes and dated reports operate on those actual files. Deleting the last file hides the empty folder and returns to the upload entry without removing other folders.

To check an institution’s required documents, open **Checklist → Add application instructions** explicitly. Choose an editable starter, paste your actual instructions or select the versioned reference. Confirm the rules before activating them. Only this instructions mode shows missing application requirements and conditional profile questions. Changing modes preserves your originals and historical reports; existing evidence assignments require a fresh review against the chosen instructions.

Older folders without an explicit mode open with a checklist derived from their actual uploaded files. Their prior reference/custom instructions, profile and reports remain stored; nothing is erased by this display change. The isolated demo explicitly uses instructions mode.

Uploads continue by themselves after a dropped connection and wait while the browser is offline. If you reload or switch devices mid-upload, **Unfinished uploads** offers **Finish upload** for the same file from where it stopped.

**My documents** lists every original once; add one to another application without uploading it again. In Documents, the crop button on a JPEG fits a photo or signature to the checklist's size limits and saves a new version beside the original.

Batch intake reports each file separately. A rejected file does not stop later files from being attempted or remove accepted files. Duplicate bytes return the existing document without a second copy. A lost first-upload response is recovered into the original folder; retrying the same batch reuses that folder. Retry temporary failures or choose a supported replacement. Intake acceptance and successful inspection are separate states.

The report distinguishes supported technical checks and applicant content confirmation. Changing a profile, file, evidence link, checklist or application details makes an earlier report historical. Changing custom requirements or original instruction notes resets prior content confirmations. A newer evaluator version also marks older snapshots historical. Running a fresh review creates a new snapshot. A retry with unchanged revisions, checklist version and evaluator version reuses the existing run.

Export JSON for machine-readable provenance, or use **Print / PDF** for a printable report. The printable report includes source, version and coverage limits. Exports are private authenticated responses.

**Download folder** exports a ZIP containing exact inspected originals, the current checklist/review manifest and coverage notes. Processing or failed files are excluded and identified in the manifest. The ZIP is a private export of originals; it does not transform files for a specific institution’s upload portal.

Use **Applications** to search, sort, open, archive or restore your applications. Archive preserves documents and history; deletion removes them. Deadlines have private in-app reminders using Asia/Kolkata calendar dates. Reminder preferences are in Settings & privacy. Verified addresses can opt in to email reminders, and each browser can turn on notifications that arrive while DocSathi is closed; see [account email operations](ACCOUNT_EMAIL.md). Application URLs preserve your current application and section across refresh and browser navigation; server ownership checks still apply.

The workspace uses top navigation throughout. On narrow screens, the horizontal tabs scroll and keep the selected section visible. Help and settings remain available beside the tabs and in the account menu. **Ctrl/Cmd + K** focuses workspace search. The account menu supports arrow keys and Escape; Escape returns focus to its trigger. Dialogs keep keyboard focus inside and make the header/content inactive until dismissed. Operating-system reduced-motion preferences disable decorative animations and transitions. The visible **Pause animations** control also stops motion; this preference persists in the current browser. **Resume animations** restores it unless the system requests reduced motion.

Use **Quick actions** or **Ctrl/Cmd + .** to search available actions and sections. Arrow keys move through enabled results, Enter chooses an action, and Escape closes the dialog. Creating applications, choosing uploads and saving reviews invoke the same real workflows as the section controls. The per-item checklist strip opens the report; it does not silently save a new review.

In **Settings & privacy**, update your display name, change your password using the current password, or sign out other sessions. Password changes revoke previous sessions and rotate the current session/CSRF token. Email verification and **Forgot password** work when SMTP is configured, or through the local outbox during development.

## Document limits

Local engineering limits are 10 MB per file, 10 files and 30 MB per packet, and 20 pages per PDF. These are service limits, not asserted official application limits. JPEG decoding is bounded to 20 million pixels. Files are inspected in a separate Node process with a 192 MB JavaScript heap budget and a 45-second wall-time deadline.

Development defaults to process isolation. Production additionally requires Linux namespace isolation with no host networking/private data, read-only input, 30-second CPU and bounded temporary/output limits. Docker sets aggregate memory, CPU and process ceilings and disables container swap. Host-policy and external security review remain separate requirements. Persisted attempt counts prevent an interrupted original repeatedly crashing a restarting API; an explicit applicant retry resets the count.

Only PDF and JPEG originals are accepted. The actual file content is inspected. `.jpeg` is accepted into the document library, but the reference requirement checks `.jpg` when that extension is specified. Encrypted, damaged or unsupported files remain unavailable for download and evidence linking. Failed inspection can be retried or the file deleted.

Text-based PDF extraction preserves page numbers. Image-only PDF pages and JPEGs use bundled local English OCR, capped at eight pages per document. Extraction records coordinates, confidence and uncertainty warnings. Download and inspect the original when extraction is empty or uncertain. OCR is a reading aid; content still requires explicit applicant review. Confirm or correct structured facts in the document viewer, or add a clearly attributed manual fact when a labelled value was not extracted.

## Data and deletion

Metadata is in `.data/metadata.sqlite` and originals are in `.data/objects`, unless `DATA_DIR` is changed. The directory is ignored by Git. Metadata and originals are outside the web asset directory. Passwords use salted scrypt hashes. Sessions use HTTP-only same-site cookies and server-side token hashes; state-changing requests require CSRF tokens.

Deleting a document removes its active original, extraction and evidence links, and purges saved packet reports to remove retained evidence references. Deleting a packet removes all its documents, jobs and reports. Account deletion removes every owned packet and invalidates sessions. Minimal audit events for a document or packet deletion are retained until account deletion. Demo workspaces expire after 24 hours.

Scheduled encrypted backups run when configured; operator-triggered backup and restore, including deletion replay, are described in [review-engine contracts](REVIEW_ENGINE.md) and the [deployment guide](DEPLOY.md). SQLite WAL free pages and external filesystem backups can retain deleted bytes; active-record deletion is not a forensic erasure guarantee. Off-site copies and the production retention policy still need review. Restore clears reviewer registrations in addition to sessions and account links; reverify reviewer identities so older backups cannot reactivate revoked approvals.

## Checks

- `npm run typecheck` checks the TypeScript contracts.
- `npm test` runs domain, API and actual worker tests using generated fixtures.
- `npm run build` creates the client bundle in `dist`.
- `npx playwright install chromium` installs the browser for local end-to-end tests.
- `npm run test:e2e` tests desktop/mobile journeys and automated accessibility.
- `npm run check` runs type checking, domain/API/worker tests and the client build.
- `npm run format` formats application source without reformatting the historical startup plan.

To serve the built client and API together locally, run `npm run build`, set `APP_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:3001`, then run `npm start` and open that URL. For a custom port, use a matching origin. Node environment variables override values in `.env`.

Browser checks start their own API on port 3102 and web client on port 5180, with a separate temporary data directory. Leave these two ports available; they never reuse the personal server on 3001/5173. Failed checks retain local traces in ignored `test-results/`; CI uploads them for seven days. Fixture account cleanup never targets a personal account.

## Failure recovery

A server restart requeues interrupted inspections and keeps saved upload chunks; open uploads resume from their last saved chunk. Failed inspection is visible in the document view and can be retried. An upload retry with identical bytes returns the existing document. An evaluation retry with unchanged input revisions returns the existing run. Stale mutations return a conflict and require current packet state.

Do not delete the data directory while a server is running. Stop the server before moving or backing up local data. For test cleanup, stop the server and remove only the deliberately disposable test data directory. The application never automatically resets a personal workspace at startup.

## Current boundaries

The UCEED 2027 reference checklist is not a reviewed complete official pack. Editable starters and mechanical instruction-line import are implemented; automatic semantic rule interpretation is not. No automated authenticity, eligibility, category entitlement, legal identity, portrait-quality or certificate-validity decision exists. Additional OCR languages, verified production email delivery, payments, institutional access, native apps and all public launch gates remain tracked work. Instructions-PDF drafting, resumable intake, password recovery, email verification, background reminders by email and Web Push, and consented support access are implemented; see the operational contracts below. Hosting is deliberately deferred while the requested runtime is localhost.


## Hosting

See [deployment](DEPLOY.md) for Docker, Render, HTTPS, scheduled backups and virus scanning.

## Off-site recovery rehearsal

`backup:offsite` and `backup` load `.env` without overriding existing environment values. Initialise a configured restic repository once with `npm run backup:offsite -- init`. Scheduled backups stream encrypted bytes rather than holding the entire archive in memory; incomplete/invalid snapshots never become usable archives. Missing/deleted originals fail the operation and clean its reserved output. The original `JKYBACK1` format remains readable.

To rehearse disaster recovery, stop the server and use a separate private staging directory. Choose an exact archive snapshot and the newest erasure-ledger snapshot, not an unqualified `latest` across different snapshot tags:

```sh
npm run backup:offsite -- snapshots
restic snapshots --tag jky-erasure-ledger
restic check --read-data
restic restore ARCHIVE_SNAPSHOT_ID --target /private/download
restic restore LEDGER_SNAPSHOT_ID --target /private/download
# Restic preserves original absolute paths beneath the download directory.
DELETION_LEDGER=/private/download/data/deletions.jsonl npm run backup -- restore \
  /private/download/backups/CHOSEN_ARCHIVE.jkyback /private/recovered
```

Use the actual backed-up paths shown by the selected snapshots. Merge any newer surviving ledger before recovery, retaining every erasure entry. After host loss, mirrored erasures can lag by at least the polling/network interval; establish the accepted erasure boundary before reopening. Restore publishes its new directory only after database/foreign-key checks, deletion replay and object hashes pass; failures remove staging. Sessions, account links and reviewer registrations are cleared. All mail queues/subscriptions and email verification are cleared, email opt-in is reset, and support grants are revoked so a pre-revocation snapshot cannot reauthorize contact or access. Push key files are preserved and checked when present; older archives without them need new browser subscriptions. Review identities must be checked again.

Approved under-18 accounts return to guardian approval while preserving recoverable originals; no approval is manufactured and no invitation is sent by restore. Restored queued or interrupted inspections remain held until renewed approval, without consuming retry attempts or blocking adult jobs. Applicants can resend/change the guardian from the waiting page. Reapproval must occur within the renewed 14-day pending-account period; otherwise normal account erasure applies. Plan and explain this recovery step before reopening to participants. Accounts already erased by withdrawal are removed by deletion replay, not reopened for reapproval.

Record snapshot IDs/times, recoverable-erasure boundary, exact original-byte verification, expired session/link checks and measured recovery duration. Check repository integrity and retention separately. A local repository rehearsal does not prove a physically independent off-site copy. Restore currently decrypts/unzips offline in memory, so provide capacity for the selected archive; it is never run inside the serving API. Keep passwords outside the lost host and decrypted staging private, then remove staging after the rehearsal.

## Development email, notifications and support

- Without SMTP settings, `npm run dev` saves recovery, verification, guardian and reminder emails to `.data/outbox`; read them with `npm run outbox` or `npm run outbox -- latest`. `MAIL_TRANSPORT=none` switches email off. Never available in production.
- Under-18 sign-up: the guardian approves from the emailed link; until then the applicant sees a waiting page and cannot add documents. Accounts not approved in 14 days are erased by the hourly sweep. See [applicant tools](APPLICANT_TOOLS.md).
- Notifications use VAPID keys generated into `.data/vapid.json` on first start, or `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`/`VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`/`VAPID_SUBJECT` from the environment. Browsers only allow push on `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` or HTTPS.
- Help → **Contact support** creates a request with a reference such as `JKY-1A2B3C4D`. Applicants choose whether support may see one application for 24 or 72 hours and can revoke it. Operators work from the data directory:

```sh
npm run support -- list
npm run support -- view JKY-1A2B3C4D --operator "Your name"
npm run support -- close JKY-1A2B3C4D --operator "Your name"
```

`view` prints the request and, only while access is granted, a redacted summary: checklist states, file names and sizes, and the latest report summary. It never prints document contents, extracted text, notes or facts, and each view is recorded in the applicant's activity. Closing a request ends any access still open.

## PDF intake and email operations

[Durable intake and instruction review](INTAKE_AND_RECOVERY.md) describes chunk expiry, resume after reload, applicant confirmation and deleted-source invalidation. [Official source review](OFFICIAL_REVIEW_AND_BENCHMARK.md) describes the current UCEED scope and blind correctness adjudication. [Account email operations](ACCOUNT_EMAIL.md) lists SMTP settings, verification and opt-in, retry behavior, Web Push and live-delivery validation. Reviewers of the UCEED pack and the benchmark labels can work from offline workbooks: `npm run rules -- review-sheet --dossier <dossier.json> --out <review.html>` and `npm run benchmark:review -- sheet <blind.json> <labels.html>`.

Use the [version-3 independent review workflow](INDEPENDENT_REVIEW.md) for new approvals: complete the offline workbook, sign with the reviewer's own key, verify the registered identity and execute the imported labels. Typed attribution alone cannot publish a pack. Official scope approval also requires the exact source pack's profile/evidence benchmark; generic regression success is insufficient.

A stopped server cannot generate or send reminders; closing the browser is supported. If delivery fails, inspect queue statuses and transport configuration without logging tokens, SMTP credentials or email bodies. Correct the provider configuration before retrying failed rows through a reviewed operator recovery process; expired account requests need a fresh link request. Restore into a new directory with the current deletion ledger. Recovery clears active sessions and account-link tokens; applicants must sign in again.

## Reproducible synthetic disaster rehearsal

Run `npm run recovery:rehearse -- --out /private/recovery.json` with restic installed, or run the same CLI inside the restricted image with `--sandbox`. `RESTIC_BINARY` may select a private executable path. The tool owns disposable storage and a temporary encrypted repository, creates synthetic adult accounts and actual PDF originals, backs them up, erases an account and another document, restores exact acknowledged snapshot IDs with the newer deletion ledger, verifies retained bytes and checks revoked sessions/reviewer authority. It removes its accounts, decrypted data, repository and temporary credentials. Only the outcome report persists. No existing personal `DATA_DIR` or remote provider is modified.

A local rehearsal establishes implementation behavior, not physically separate storage, whole-volume encryption, a provider retention decision or recovery-time objectives. Record those from the actual hosting environment using the [launch evidence workflow](LAUNCH_EVIDENCE.md). Repository acknowledgements now bind the configured repository hash; changing repositories cannot reuse an old successful archive receipt. Archive and ledger operations are serialized within the runtime to avoid racing repository locks. The ledger acknowledgement includes the conservatively captured current file stamp; newer erasures remain pending and cause another mirror attempt. Network or active-file changes can still delay successful mirroring.

Low free space now refuses original/chunk/library-copy writes while retaining at least 256 MiB of estimated metadata/erasure headroom, with additional allowance for SQLite/WAL and copies. Storage checks are pre-write estimates, not cross-process reservations or quotas. A 507 response keeps an acknowledged chunk offset unchanged; retry after recovery resumes that offset. Monitor free space and backup/erasure acknowledgement alerts. Reclaim database/filesystem space through a separately reviewed offline maintenance procedure rather than deleting personal storage or bypassing headroom.
