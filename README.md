  <b>DocSathi</b> helps students in India prepare the documents for college, scholarship and job applications.<br />
  Upload your originals, turn the institution’s instructions into a checklist, fix what portals reject, and see exactly what is still missing.
</p>

---

## What it does

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Checklist from the instructions PDF** | Every requirement is drafted with the page it came from. You confirm each one. |
| **Photo and signature fixer** | Crop, rotate and compress a JPEG to the portal’s exact pixel and KB limits, in the browser. |
| **Name and date-of-birth check** | Finds spelling, initials, missing middle names and swapped dates across your documents. |
| **Upload once, use everywhere** | One library of originals, added to any application without uploading again. |
| **Knows what a document is** | “Looks like: Aadhaar card”, so the right file goes to the right checklist item. |
| **Under-18 friendly** | A parent or guardian approves the account before documents can be added, and can withdraw at any time. Development emails go to the local outbox. |
| **Works on bad networks** | Uploads resume from the last saved piece; the app installs on your phone. |
| **Keep track of deadlines** | In-app reminders are available. Email and browser notifications are optional integrations and are not part of the fictional demo. |

## How it works

Nothing becomes “ready” on its own: unknown answers, unread pages and unconfirmed facts stay visible until you check them against the original.

| Layer | Built with |
| --- | --- |
| Browser | React 19, TypeScript, Vite, PDF.js, canvas image processing, installable web app |
| Server | Node.js 22, Express 5, zod validation, helmet, per-session rate limits, CSRF tokens |
| Workers | Bounded PDF.js text extraction and English OCR; production adds Bubblewrap isolation and configured ClamAV scanning. SMTP and Web Push delivery are optional integrations. |
| Data | SQLite metadata and private originals; encrypted scheduled backups and off-site recovery require operator configuration. |

## Get started

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` starts the Express API and Vite frontend. Application metadata is stored in `.data/metadata.sqlite`; original files stay server-side in `.data/objects/`. These are not stored in browser `localStorage`.

Open **http://127.0.0.1:5173**, then choose **Explore the demo** (fictional documents) or create an account. Without SMTP, development password-recovery and guardian emails are written to `.data/outbox/`, not delivered to an inbox; read the newest with `npm run outbox -- latest`. The fictional demo keeps in-app reminders but does not expose email or browser-push controls.

Requires **Linux, Node.js 22.12 or newer and util-linux** (kernel workspace locking). Use synthetic documents until the public launch checks below are complete.

## Put it online

```sh
cp .env.example .env            # set APP_ORIGIN, SMTP and BACKUP_PASSWORD
DOMAIN=jkyfolder.example docker compose --profile https --profile scan up -d
```

Use a compatible Linux Docker host with the supplied seccomp and, where required, AppArmor policy. Startup verifies the actual parser sandbox and requires scanning, SMTP and encrypted scheduled backups. Managed hosts, including the Render blueprint, still need compatibility verification. Details: [deployment guide](docs/engineering/DEPLOY.md).

## Quality

```sh
npm run check        # TypeScript, 522 passing tests + 6 host checks, production build
npm run test:e2e     # 61 desktop and mobile browser journeys with accessibility scans
```

The checked-in GitHub Actions workflow is configured to run both checks on pushes to `main` and pull requests, plus a separate restricted Docker job. The complete domain/API/worker suite contains 528 tests; six need the Docker integration environment. Browser tests cover real uploads and OCR, interrupted uploads, the photo fixer, guardian approval through the outbox, both themes, keyboard use, phone widths and automated WCAG 2.1 AA scans.

## Before public launch

Local application and Docker checks establish the implemented software behavior. Public readiness still requires recorded evidence:

- An independent reviewer signs off the UCEED checklist and correctness labels. Full-source workbooks, registered reviewer signatures, actual benchmark execution and exact-pack branch coverage are ready; see [the review workflow](docs/engineering/INDEPENDENT_REVIEW.md).
- A lawyer reviews privacy, the under-18 policy and the terms; an outside tester runs a security review.
- Verified storage encryption and a separate backup failure domain, approved retention, measured capacity, and actual hosting/HTTPS, inbox and closed-browser push checks.
- Assistive-technology testing and a consented pilot with real students. The [review packet](docs/engineering/PILOT_AND_EXTERNAL_REVIEW.md) defines tasks and evidence; participation is pending.

A reviewed item means the file checks passed and you confirmed the content yourself. It is never a guarantee of authenticity, eligibility or acceptance; your institution decides.
